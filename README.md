# Listing-Dates
PowerShell Script made at Work to play aronud with PS a little bit, marginally related to my other PS Project.

The script will take all items that aren't folders and then list them in a csv file alongside their last edit date.
Was thinking about making it display time but excel was showing it weird so it stays like this for now.
