# Listing-Dates
PowerShell Script made at Work to play around with PS a little bit, marginally related to my other PS Project with all the date grabbing and stuff.

The script will take all items that aren't folders and then list them in a csv file alongside their last edit date.
Was thinking about making it display time but excel was showing it weird so it stays like this for now.

I tried to work with arrays because i've never really done anything with those but it didn't work, i think i just applied the array wrong
and they're not supposed to do stuff like this? Either way im leaving it in but commented out just because. :)

Possible future additions to this project is maybe making it create a list for each folder inside the main one aswell,
adding a date of when the list was created too and not clearing old data every time. This way you could have a history 
of when you used the script and see what files you haven't done anything with in a while. 
(It's not really that useful, i certainly won't use this script for anything but it's alright for a learning experience.)
