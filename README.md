# Listing-Dates
PowerShell Script made at Work to play around with PS a little bit, marginally related to my other PS Project with all the date grabbing and stuff.

The script will take all items that aren't folders and then list them in a csv file alongside their last edit date.
Was thinking about making it display time but excel was showing it weird so it stays like this for now.

I tried to work with Array's because ive never really done that but it didn't work, i think i just applied the array wrong
and they're not supposed to do stuff like this? Either way im leaving it in but commented out just because. :)
